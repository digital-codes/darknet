The onnx.pb.* source files are generated from the onnx.proto file which exists
in the official ONNX repo.  Normally, users of Darknet/YOLO do not need to do
this as the output files are already checked into the Darknet/YOLO repo.

It is documented here so the source files can be updated by the Darknet/YOLO
developers when a new version of the ONNX .proto file is released.

First step is to download the latest onnx.proto file from the ONNX project:

    https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/onnx/onnx.proto
or:
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/onnx/onnx/refs/heads/main/onnx/onnx.proto

The last time this was done was by Stephane Charette on 2025-07-21.

Then, the protocol buffer compiler is used to generate the C++ files:

    sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
    protoc --fatal_warnings --cpp_out=. onnx.proto

This should generate both the onnx.pb.cc and onnx.pb.h source files.

This could be done with CMake using find_package(Protobuf) combined with the
macro protobuf_generate_cpp(...) but as of July 2025 it is expected that a
new onnx.proto file and corresponding files will be extremely rare, so for now
it remains a manual process in the Darknet/YOLO repo.
